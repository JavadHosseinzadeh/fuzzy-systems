this repositiory consist of two projects


1- ANFIS for function approximation


2- tuning fuzyy logic controller parameters and rules by genetic algorithm:
This project implements an inverted pendulum system that uses a FLC and optimization using the MATLAB GA toolbox for both single-objective and multi-objective approaches. For the single-objective, it covers the approach to minimize the error between the desired and actual pendulum angle, and for the multi-objective-one, optimization with criteria of minimizing the control input and angle error are conducted for the controller.
The following MATLAB files are contained in this project: some of them simulate pendulum dynamics, and others perform optimization of FLC parameters like rules, membership functions, and gains. Some of the key files are as follows: app1.m-single objective optimization; app2.m-multi-objective optimization; Inverted_Pendulum_Model.m-sets the system dynamics. The results have proved that a controller could balance the pendulum with ease, and optimized controllers are saved for future use.
